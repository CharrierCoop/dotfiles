# dotfiles

Contains my personal dotfiles for the programs I use the most. I manage them using [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). If you want to quickly use one of my configs, go the directory where you cloned this repo (eg. `~/dotfiles`) and use `stow emacs` to create the desired symlinks. Use `stow -D emacs` to remove the symlinks.
